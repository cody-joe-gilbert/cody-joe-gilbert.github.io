## Development Languages <a name="development_languages"></a>
These are the languages I've used to develop applications in both professional and academic environments.


#### Python <a name="python"></a>
**Skill Level:** 8/10

Python is my dynamically-typed language of choice for development, automated analysis, and ad-hoc analyses. 
I've published numerous tutorials on Python coding on the tutorial website [rwells.com]( https://wellsr.com/python ), the links of which can be found on my [Python Tutorials]({{ site.url }}/projects/python_tutorials/) page.


#### C++ <a name="C++"></a>
**Skill Level:** 4/10

C++ is the compiled language I've used in operating system simulation projects within an NYU course on operating systems. The code I've created can be found in my [Operating Systems Projects]({{ site.url }}/projects/#osclass) repository.
C++ is not a fun language in which to develop, but I can read and write code for application development should the need arise.


#### Scala <a name="scala"></a>
**Skill Level:** 5/10

This functional programming language has been the backbone for my Spark applications. I've used this language primarily in academic projects at NYU in courses on programming languages and Spark. See my [HMDA Project]({{ site.url }}/projects/#hmda) for an example.


#### OCaml <a name="ocaml"></a>
**Skill Level:** 2/10

I've used OCaml during academic studies at NYU on functional programming languages. This code is difficult to parse for users with a background of imperative languages, but has advantages for distributed processing and theorem proofing.


#### Fortran <a name="fortran"></a>
**Skill Level:** 6/10

This extremely old imperative language is still in use within the nuclear and scientific computing fields. I've used Fortran in my undergraduate career and in my role as a Nuclear Fuels Engineer at Duke Energy. Most nuclear simulation codes such as Framatome MICROBURN-B2 and POWERPLEX are written in Fortran to optimize for fast calculations.

## Analysis Languages <a name="analysis_languages"></a>
These are the languages I've used to analyze and process data in ad-hoc studies, as well as within scientific computing applications.


#### SQL <a name="sql"></a>
**Skill Level:** 5/10

I have studied SQL independently of academic and professional using online resources, as it is a vital part of data analysis and inquiry.


#### Matlab <a name="matlab"></a>
**Skill Level:** 5/10

I've used Matlab during my research positions at both NCSU and NYU to create scientific applications for model uncertainty and model reduction.


#### R <a name="r"></a>
**Skill Level:** 5/10

I've used R primarily in academic studies and projects for data analysis and machine learning. See my [Machine Learning Project]({{ site.url }}/projects/#statlearn) for an example project I created at Hunter College that used R extensively.


## Applications <a name="applications"></a>
These are the applications/APIs I've used in various projects. 


#### Hadoop <a name="hadoop"></a>
**Skill Level:** 4/10

I've taken formal classes on the Hadoop ecosystem and its underlying software such as YARN, HDFS, Hive, HBase, and MapReduce. These courses focused on user applications and projects, with minor discussions on Hadoop administration. See an example project using [Hadoop tools here]({{ site.url }}/projects/#napa). 


#### Spark <a name="spark"></a>
**Skill Level:** 6/10

I've taken formal classes on Spark and I've created applications and projects using Spark with Scala. These projects included the use of SparkSQL, GeoSpark, and MLLib with the use of a YARN-enabled Hadoop cluster. See an [example project here]({{ site.url }}/projects/#hmda). 


#### LaTeX <a name="latex"></a>
**Skill Level:** 5/10

LaTeX is the standard typesetting tool used in academia, and I've used it extensively in my graduate studies. See my [NYU TA lesson plans]({{ site.url }}/projects/#recitation) for examples.


#### Framatome MICROBURN-B2 and POWERPLEX <a name="mb2"></a>
**Skill Level:** 5/10

The MICROBURN-B2 software suite was developed by Framatome for nuclear core neutronics and thermal hydraulic modeling, and is used within the POWERPLEX realtime nuclear core monitoring system. I used these applications regularly during my tenure as a Nuclear Fuel Engineer at Duke Energy while performing engineering calculations for the Brunswick Nuclear Power Plant.
