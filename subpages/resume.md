#### Research Assistant

**Organization:** New York University

**Location:** New York, NY

**Dates:** Jan 2019 - July 2019

**Description:** Research assistant under Professor Benjamin Peherstorfer in model reduction methods. This role involved applying model reduction methods including Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (DEIM), and Adaptive Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (ADEIM) on a simulated rocket combustion model to accelerate the computation of approximate state solutions.

#### Recitation Leader

**Organization:** New York University

**Location:** New York, NY

**Dates:** Jan 2019 - May 2019

**Description:** Worked with Professor Antoine Cerfon to give weekly supplementary fluid dynamics instruction to a class of 15-20 students. Ciriculum included vector calculus, thermodynamics, Euler equations and associated solutions, the Navier-Stokes equations and approximations, and other mechanical principles.

#### Nuclear Fuel Engineer (Nuclear Engineer II)

**Organization:** Duke Energy

**Location:** Charlotte, NC

**Dates:** June 2015 - Jan 2018

**Description:** I worked as a nuclear fuel engineer for the Duke Energy utility company in supporting the operations and refueling campaigns of the Brunswick Nuclear Plant. 
My duties included:

* Supporting periodic plant operations by preparing power and safetly margin projections using core simulation software (Framatome MICROBURN-B2 and POWERPLEX)
* Creating design calculations to support biannual core reload that verified core shuffle sub-criticality, control blade material integrity, and startup operation safety margins
* Provided emergent issue support, including the creation of high-quality engineering designs under tight time constraints
* Generated short-term and long-term power and core operation predictions using core modeling software

#### Python Tutorial Writing

**Status:** Active

**Description:** I've written dozens of Python tutorials for both beginners and power users. These tutorials have been published by the software consulting service [rwells.com]( https://wellsr.com/python ). See my [Python Tutorials]({{ site.url }}/projects/python_tutorials/) page for more details and links to my tutorials.

#### HMDA Data Exploration with Spark

**Status:** Complete

[Github Repository]( https://github.com/cody-joe-gilbert/SU19SparkClass )

[Paper]( https://github.com/cody-joe-gilbert/SU19SparkClass/blob/master/presentation/paper/HMDA_Paper.pdf )

**Description:** This project seeks to find patterns of discriminatory lending using data provided by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
(CFPB) as part of the Home Mortage Disclosure Act (HMDA). 

#### Finding Napa

**Status:** Complete

[Github Repository]( https://github.com/cody-joe-gilbert/SU19Hadoop )

[Paper]( https://github.com/cody-joe-gilbert/SU19Hadoop/blob/master/TeamPaper.pdf )

**Description:** This analysis aggregates weather, soil, and sunlight data over a set of US geographic regions and time periods to select areas that best replicate those of Napa Valley given a trend of climate change. This project used Hadoop tools including MapReduce, Hive, and HDFS to process big data for analysis.
