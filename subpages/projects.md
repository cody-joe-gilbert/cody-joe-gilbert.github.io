### Professional Projects <a name="professional"></a>

#### Python Tutorial Writing <a name="tutorials"></a>

* **Status:** Active
* [Python Tutorials Page]({{ site.url }}/projects/python_tutorials/)
* **Description:** Python, being my favorite dynamically-typed object-oriented language, has been my standard tool for analysis and development. To share the insights I've collected over the years using, I've written dozens of tutorials for both beginners and power users of the language. These tutorials have been published by the software consulting service [rwells.com]( https://wellsr.com/python ).

#### Brunswick Nuclear Core Reload <a name="brunswick"></a>

* **Status:** Completed
* [Example Published Report]( https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1710/ML17100A840.pdf )
* **Description:** During my career as a nuclear fuel engineer for Duke Energy I participated in several core reloads for the Brunswick Nuclear Plant. These core reloads required a multitude of engineering designs and formal documents to support both technical and regulatory requirements. One example of an engineering product I created is the above Core Operating Limits Report (COLR) for operation of Brunswick Unit 2 during Cycle 23. This report details the limits of core operation over the two year fuel cycle, which were set from a series of formal engineering design calculation and documents.

### Academic Projects <a name="academic"></a>

#### HMDA Data Exploration with Spark <a name="hmda"></a>

* **Status:** Complete
* [Github Repository]( https://github.com/cody-joe-gilbert/SU19SparkClass )
* [Paper]( https://github.com/cody-joe-gilbert/SU19SparkClass/blob/master/presentation/paper/HMDA_Paper.pdf )
* **Description:** This project seeks to find patterns of discriminatory lending using data provided by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
(CFPB) as part of the Home Mortage Disclosure Act (HMDA). The goal of the project was to create a machine learning model from the HMDA data that would indicate differences in loan approval rate between members of a given race, ethnicity, or gender. As a school project limited over the course of a month, the final model and webapp is not perfect by any means, but the project served to learn Spark, distributed computing, creating application with big data, and machine learning with big data.

#### Finding Napa <a name="napa"></a>

* Status: Complete
* [Github Repository]( https://github.com/cody-joe-gilbert/SU19Hadoop )
* [Paper]( https://github.com/cody-joe-gilbert/SU19Hadoop/blob/master/TeamPaper.pdf )
* **Description:** The time-tested traditional methods of wine production have begun to be impacted with the advent of rapid climate change. This analysis seeks to quantify and predict those changes to allow grapevine and wine stakeholders to find new regions for growing grapes in a climate-altered future that best replicate the current conditions of the Napa Valley region. This analysis aggregates weather, soil, and sunlight data over a set of US geographic regions and time periods to select areas that best replicate those of Napa Valley given a trend of climate change. This project used Hadoop tools including MapReduce, Hive, and HDFS to process big data for analysis.

#### Machine Learning Projects with R <a name="statlearn"></a>

* Status: Complete
* [Github Repository]( https://github.com/cody-joe-gilbert/Misc_Projects/tree/master/statistical_learning_r )
* **Description:** This folder contains two statistical/machine learning projects created in R during the course of a Statistical Learning course at New York's Hunter College. This first project used an open source data set of mushroom features and their classifiction of "toxic" or "edible" to train a machine learning model to predict mushroom toxicity, and the second used particle accelerator simulation data to attempt to predict the presence of a Higgs Boson using several machine learning models.

#### AI: Parallel Program Optimization <a name="aiclass"></a>

* Status: Complete
* [Github Repository]( https://github.com/cody-joe-gilbert/Misc_Projects/tree/master/ai_projects_python )
* **Description:** This project was created as part of an NYU Artificial Intelligence class taught by Professor Ernest Davis. The goal of this project was to solve a simple parallel program optimization problem by translating the problem's constraints into propositional logic (a SAT problem) and solving with the Davis-Putnam Algorithm.

#### Fluid Dynamics Recitation <a name="recitation"></a>

* Status: Complete
* [Github Repository]( https://github.com/cody-joe-gilbert/Misc_Projects/tree/master/fluid_dynamics_recitation )
* **Description:** This project involved creating fluid dynamics lessons for each of the eleven weeks I worked as the recitation leader for the Spring 2019 NYU Fluid Dynamics Recitation. Each week introduced topics to enhance student participation and contribute to the lectures taught by Professor Antoine Cerfon.

#### Operating Systems C++ Projects <a name="osclass"></a>

* Status: Complete
* [Github Repository]( https://github.com/cody-joe-gilbert/Misc_Projects/tree/master/operating_systems_cpp )
* **Description:** This repository contains the C++ projects I created for the labs within the NYU Operating Systems classes. Each lab folder contains an assignment to simulate some portion of an operating system using C++. This repository contains four projects for simulating an operating system's linker, thread/process scheduler, virtual memory management unit, and IO scheduler.
