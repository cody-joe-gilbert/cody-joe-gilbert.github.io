Here you can find the projects I've worked on that span over my academic and professional careers.

#### Python Tutorial Writing

Status: Active

Description: Python, being my favorite dynamically-typed object-oriented language, has been my standard tool for analysis and development. To share the insights I've collected over the years using, I've written dozens of tutorials for both beginners and power users of the language. These tutorials have been published by the software consulting service [rwells.com]( https://wellsr.com/python ). See my [Python Tutorials]() page for more details and links to my tutorials.

#### HMDA Data Exploration with Spark

Status: Complete

[Github Repository]( https://github.com/cody-joe-gilbert/SU19SparkClass )

[Paper]( https://github.com/cody-joe-gilbert/SU19SparkClass/blob/master/presentation/paper/HMDA_Paper.pdf )

Description: This project seeks to find patterns of discriminatory lending using data provided by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
(CFPB) as part of the Home Mortage Disclosure Act (HMDA). The goal of the project was to create a machine learning model from the HMDA data that would indicate differences in loan approval rate between members of a given race, ethnicity, or gender. As a school project limited over the course of a month, the final model and webapp is not perfect by any means, but the project served to learn Spark, distributed computing, creating application with big data, and machine learning with big data.

#### Finding Napa

Status: Complete

[Github Repository]( https://github.com/cody-joe-gilbert/SU19Hadoop )

[Paper]( https://github.com/cody-joe-gilbert/SU19Hadoop/blob/master/TeamPaper.pdf )

Description: The time-tested traditional methods of wine production have begun to be impacted with the advent of rapid climate change. This analysis seeks to quantify and predict those changes to allow grapevine and wine stakeholders to find new regions for growing grapes in a climate-altered future that best replicate the current conditions of the Napa Valley region. This analysis aggregates weather, soil, and sunlight data over a set of US geographic regions and time periods to select areas that best replicate those of Napa Valley given a trend of climate change. This project used Hadoop tools including MapReduce, Hive, and HDFS to process big data for analysis.
