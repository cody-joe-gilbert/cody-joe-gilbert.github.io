Here is a listing of all my past work experience, from most to least recent.

#### Data Analyst Intern

* **Organization:** [Betterfin]( https://betterfin.com/ )
* **Location:** Brooklyn, NY
* **Dates:** Aug 2019 - Present
* **Description:** This internship focused on implementing APIs with Python to connect disparate data sources (external CRM databases, US Census open source APIs, internal PostgreSQL servers, etc.) to a common data lake, and to perform data analysis on the aggregated records.
These analyses focused on providing actionable information to small businesses seeking additional capital, such as:
	* Finding yearly trends Startup Early Survival Rate for a given US region using data extracted from the Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship to determine what industries within that region have the highest chances of long-term success
	* Evaluating small business owner sentiment on acquiring additional funding using US Census Annual Business Survey (ABS) data
	* Finding average employee payroll and wages for a given US region and industry using U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data, which small business owners can use to evaluate their standing in comparison to their peers.
This position also included several development projects:
	* Creating tools to interface local Python applications to external PostgreSQL databases
	* Building interactive visual dashboards using Flask and Dash.
	* Creating a fuzzy-search method within a moderately-large database (>30 million records) using a combination of PostgreSQL trigram indexing and machine learning to estimate the match likelihood of two vectors of business identifying information

#### Research Assistant

* **Organization:** [New York University]( https://cims.nyu.edu/ )
* **Location:** New York, NY
* **Dates:** Jan 2019 - July 2019
* **Description:** I worked as a research assistant under Professor Benjamin Peherstorfer in model reduction methods. This role involved applying model reduction methods including Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (DEIM), and Adaptive Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (ADEIM) on a simulated rocket combustion model to accelerate the computation of approximate state solutions. All methods were created using Matlab.

#### Recitation Leader

* **Organization:** [New York University]( https://cims.nyu.edu/ )
* **Location:** New York, NY
* **Dates:** Jan 2019 - May 2019
* **Description:** I worked as a recitation leader for a Fluid Dynamics course during the Spring 2019 semester. This role involved working with Professor Antoine Cerfon to give weekly supplementary fluid dynamics instruction to a class of 15-20 students. Curriculum included vector calculus, thermodynamics, Euler equations and associated solutions, the Navier-Stokes equations and approximations, and other mechanical principles.

#### Nuclear Fuel Engineer (Nuclear Engineer II)

* **Organization:** [Duke Energy]( https://www.duke-energy.com/home )
* **Location:** Charlotte, NC
* **Dates:** June 2015 - Jan 2018
* **Description:** I worked as a nuclear fuel engineer for the Duke Energy utility company in supporting the operations and refueling campaigns of the Brunswick Nuclear Plant. My duties included:
	* Supporting periodic plant operations by preparing power and safety margin projections using core simulation software (Framatome MICROBURN-B2 and POWERPLEX)
	* Creating design calculations to support biannual core reload that verified core shuffle sub-criticality, control blade material integrity, and startup operation safety margins
	* Provided emergent issue support, including the creation of high-quality engineering designs under tight time constraints
	* Generated short-term and long-term power and core operation predictions using core modeling software

#### Nuclear Test Engineering Intern

* **Organization:** [Newport News Shipbuilding]( https://nns.huntingtoningalls.com/ )
* **Location:** Newport News, VA
* **Dates:** May 2014 - Aug 2014
* **Description:** I worked as a Summer 2014 intern within the Nuclear Test Engineering department of Newport New Shipbuilding aboard the in-construction USS Gerald R. Ford. My duties included:
	* Assisting test engineers in the execution of test procedures within the nuclear propulsion system and A1B class aircraft carrier reactors.
	* Scheduling and performing periodic maintenance of plant mechanical systems, primarily of the lubrication system and propulsion shaft main reduction gearbox.

#### CASL Research Assistant

* **Organization:** [North Carolina State University, Consortium for Advanced Simulation of Light Water Reactors (CASL)]( https://www.casl.gov/ )
* **Location:** Raleigh, NC
* **Dates:** Jan 2013 - May 2013
* **Description:** I worked as an undergraduate research assistance within the CASL Undergraduate Scholarship program under the mentorship of NCSU Professor Ralph Smith. This research primarily focused on learning the elements of model statistical validation and verification. I concentrated on model development and uncertainty quantification using Matlab to code parameter selection techniques and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms to determine parameter distributions for given models. 

#### Reactor Services Engineering Intern

* **Organization:** [Newport News Shipbuilding]( https://nns.huntingtoningalls.com/ )
* **Location:** Newport News, VA
* **Dates:** May 2013 - Aug 2013
* **Description:** I worked as a Summer 2013 intern within the Reactor Services Engineering department of Newport New Shipbuilding to support the refueling of the USS Abraham Lincoln. My duties primarily involved the creation and revision of technical work documents and maintenance instructions used in the refueling of A4W aircraft carrier reactors. 

#### Plasma Research Assistant

* **Organization:** [North Carolina State University]( https://www.ncsu.edu/ )
* **Location:** Raleigh, NC
* **Dates:** Jan 2013 - May 2013
* **Description:** I worked as an undergraduate research assistant to a PhD student researching low pressure plasmas. This research examined the relation between plasma light emission and the partial pressures of gaseous components. My duties included data collection using Langmuir probes and photomultiplier tubes to determine plasma properties. In this position I learned fundamental plasma physics, data collection, and data analysis.
